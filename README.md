# Simple GUI python program to show user's facebook events on the desktop.

### What is it?
This is a school project where I will orientate myself to create desktop GUI program with python. Also I want to learn to make simple user interfaces using some python library.

### Idea
I think that Facebook is the number one site to manage public and private events today. 
Everyone has facebook account so it's an easy way to connect people and share own events. What I want is a way to display a list of my own events of interest straight to my desktop to help me remember them better the same way as my sticky notes help me remembering daily tasks.

For me the events are mostly the only reason I go to Facebook, so It would be fun to have a small "event note application" on your desktop.

### What to learn from this?
From this project I want to learn or get better at the following
- Fetching data from API using python
- Making a good looking user interface with some python library
- Making runnable desktop app
- Python syntax and general coding performance

### Technologies to be used
- Python3
- Python libraries that fit my project
- Facebook Graphi API
- Git
